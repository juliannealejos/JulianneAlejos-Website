        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Julianne Alejos and I am currently a college freshman as an English major at the University of California-Riverside (UCR). I am a full-time student who is active in both her school and community.  I am a first-generation college student, which has motivated me to pursue higher education to achieve success financially and intellectually. Growing up in a family who no one has ever been enrolled in a four-year college, I have been motivated by a very young age to pursue my greatest dream, becoming a writer. Writing has been a passion of mine since I was in elementary school. Growing up, I would read an endless amount of books and I had grown up to admire those who could bring their imaginations alive through a merely a series of pages. As I grew up, my admiration of authors had transformed into one of the journalists. Through my writing, I want to be an effective storyteller, so my audience can envision a picture merely through my words. Most importantly, I wish to connect with an audience of all demographics because I want my work to convey a universal meaning. <br><br>

        Along with school, I have grown as an individual through my work experience. My first job was in high school where I worked as a school newspaper editor, which helped me learn to work efficiently independently and collaboratively. My tasks included scheduling and assigning duties to staff writers, reviewing and editing articles, and leading team-building exercises. Recently, I worked as a seasonal cashier at Target where I greeted and assisted customers by collecting payments of cash, check, or charge payments from customers. Also, I quickly acquired the necessary skills to use the new technology, which was an electronic cash register. Along with this, I was hired to bag customersâ€™ groceries or purchases in accordance with best practices to avoid damage to customersâ€™ items and to maintain a balanced register and restocked items for the front register lanes as needed. Also, I previously worked as a sales representative at the clothing store, American Eagle Outfitters. As a salesperson, I was there to assist customers in sales with one-on-one styling experience. Also, I organized the display and stock shelves, which gave me the experience working independently. Lastly, I worked primarily in the fitting room where I directed customers to the fitting room and provided assistance when necessary. Also, I upheld the fitting room standards by ensuring it was clear of merchandise, hangers, and other items. Through my experience in the school and work environment, Iâ€™ve gained strong analytical, organizational, verbal, and written communication skills. Also, Iâ€™ve become a hard-working team worker who can easily adapt to varying and highly dynamic working conditions.
